  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <p class="help">Master the art of finding words in grids</p>

  <h3>🎯 Basic Rules</h3>
  <p>Find words hidden in letter grids. Words can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, and may read forwards or backwards.</p>

  <h3>💡 Tips & Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start with longer words</strong> - they're easier to spot and give more points</li>
    <li><strong>Look for common patterns</strong> - -ING, -ED, -ER endings are frequent</li>
    <li><strong>Scan systematically</strong> - try each row, then each column</li>
    <li><strong>Check diagonals last</strong> - they're trickier but often contain bonus words</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🏆 Scoring</h3>
  <p>Points are awarded based on word length and difficulty. Longer words and rare letter combinations score higher.</p>

  <h3>⚡ Power-ups</h3>
  <p>Use credits to reveal hints, highlight word categories, or get time extensions in timed challenges.</p>

  <h3>🎮 Game Modes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Classic</strong> - Find all words at your own pace</li>
    <li><strong>Timed</strong> - Race against the clock for bonus points</li>
    <li><strong>Daily Challenge</strong> - Special themed puzzles with unique rewards</li>
  </ul>
