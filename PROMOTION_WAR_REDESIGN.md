# 🏆 Promotion War System Redesign

## 🎯 Overview
Transform the confusing "boost war" into strategic "promotion wars" with clear winners, losers, and consequences.

## 📋 New Rules

### 🚀 War Mechanics
- **Name**: "Promotion War" (not "Boost War")
- **Duration**: 1 hour battle window
- **Goal**: Accumulate highest promotion points across all your posts
- **Stakes**: Meaningful rewards and penalties

### 🏆 Winner Benefits (24 hours)
1. **Extended Promotion**: Posts stay promoted 2x longer
2. **Penalty Immunity**: Cannot receive promotion penalties
3. **Promotion Discount**: Next 3 promotions cost 8 credits (not 10)
4. **War Champion Badge**: Visible trophy status
5. **Priority Ranking**: Posts get slight ranking boost

### 💔 Loser Penalties (24 hours)
1. **Promotion Cooldown**: 2-hour lockout from promoting posts
2. **Reduced Effectiveness**: Promotions give 7 points instead of 10
3. **Higher Costs**: Promotions cost 12 credits instead of 10
4. **Penalty Status**: "Recovering from War" indicator
5. **Lower Priority**: Posts get slight ranking reduction

### ⚔️ War Flow
1. **Challenge**: User A challenges User B
2. **Acceptance**: User B has 1 hour to accept/decline
3. **Battle**: 1-hour window where both users promote their posts
4. **Scoring**: Total promotion points accumulated during war
5. **Results**: Winner/loser effects applied immediately

### 🎮 Strategic Elements
- **Risk vs Reward**: High stakes make wars meaningful
- **Resource Management**: Credits become more valuable
- **Timing**: When to start wars, when to accept
- **Portfolio**: Managing multiple posts during war
- **Psychological**: Penalty fear vs reward desire

## 🔧 Implementation Changes

### Database
- Rename `boost_wars` → `promotion_wars` (or add new table)
- Add winner/loser penalty tracking to users
- Track war statistics and badges

### UI/UX
- Update all "boost" → "promotion" terminology

### Game Balance

- Monitor credit economy impact

## 🎯 Benefits
- **Strategic Depth**: Wars become meaningful decisions
- **Community Engagement**: Higher stakes = more excitement
- **Economic Balance**: Credits become more valuable
