## Session Activity Tracking & Auto-Logout System - January 19, 2025

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive session management with activity monitoring to keep users logged in while active, but provide polite warnings before auto-logout due to inactivity.

### Problem Solved
- Users want to stay logged in as long as they're active
- Security requires automatic logout after prolonged inactivity
- Need smooth user experience without surprise logouts
- Coordination needed between frontend and backend authentication state

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Backend Session Configuration (app.py)**
- **Rolling 14-day sessions**: `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME=timedelta(days=14)`
- **Activity-based refresh**: `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST=True`
- **Remember-me functionality**: `REMEMBER_COOKIE_DURATION=timedelta(days=30)`
- **Inactivity timeout**: 30 minutes with 2-minute warning threshold

#### 2. **Activity Tracking System**
- **Constants**: `INACTIVITY_LIMIT_SEC = 60 * 30` (30 min), `WARN_AT_SEC = 60 * 2` (2 min warning)
- **Activity monitor**: `touch_activity()` before_request handler tracks `last_activity` timestamp
- **Auto-logout**: Users exceeding inactivity limit are automatically logged out
- **Session APIs**: `/api/session/status` and `/api/session/ping` for frontend monitoring

#### 3. **Frontend Activity Monitoring (base.html)**
- **Polls session status**: Every 15 seconds via `/api/session/status`
- **"Still there?" modal**: Appears when 2 minutes remain, countdown timer included
- **User activity detection**: Monitors click, keydown, mousemove, touchstart events
- **Throttled API calls**: Pings server every 10 seconds on activity (throttled to prevent spam)
- **Auto-redirect**: Redirects to login if no response within 2 minutes

#### 4. **Persistent Login Enhancement (routes.py)**
- **Login persistence**: `login_user(user, remember=True)` and `session.permanent = True`
- **Activity initialization**: `session["last_activity"] = int(time.time())` on login/register
- **Cache headers**: Added no-cache headers to login page to prevent cached redirects

#### 5. **API Security**
- **Cache-control headers**: Session APIs have `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0`
- **Authentication coordination**: Frontend checks `data-authenticated` attribute consistency
- **CSRF protection**: Session ping endpoint includes proper CSRF handling

### User Experience Flow
1. **Active users**: Sessions stay alive indefinitely as long as they're using the site
2. **Inactive users**: After 28 minutes of inactivity, see "Still there?" modal
3. **Warning period**: 2-minute countdown with "I'm still here" button
4. **Auto-logout**: If no response, graceful redirect to login page
5. **Smooth return**: Can log back in immediately without losing progress

### Files Modified
- `app.py` - Session configuration, activity tracking, session APIs
- `routes.py` - Persistent login settings, cache headers, activity initialization
- `templates/base.html` - Frontend JavaScript for activity monitoring and warning modal

### Technical Features
- **Cross-tab coordination**: Activity in any tab refreshes session for all tabs
- **Network resilience**: Handles temporary network issues gracefully
- **Security compliance**: Maintains security standards while improving UX
- **Database agnostic**: Works with both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Mobile friendly**: Touch events included for mobile device activity detection

### Deployment Status
✅ Successfully committed and pushed (commit: `2b5305c`)
✅ Session activity tracking implemented and tested
✅ "Still there?" modal system functional
✅ Rolling sessions working across browser sessions
✅ Frontend/backend authentication state fully coordinated
✅ No surprise logouts - users only logged out after clear warning

## Complete Boost War System Implementation - September 20, 2025

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive competitive Boost War system with 2-minute battles, sophisticated penalty mechanics, and complete frontend/backend architecture following user specifications.

### Major Features Implemented

#### 1. **Epic 2-Minute Battle System**
- **Battle Duration**: Reduced from 180 minutes to intense 2-minute battles for maximum engagement
- **Action-Based Combat**: 3 credits per boost/unboost action (down from 10/20 credits)
- **Real-Time Competition**: Users compete by spamming boost/unboost buttons during live battles
- **Victory Calculation**: Net score system (your_boosts - opponent_unboosts) determines winner

#### 2. **Sophisticated Penalty System**
**Database Schema Enhancements:**
```sql
-- User penalty tracking
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN boost_penalty_until DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN challenge_penalty_until DATETIME;

-- Post cooldown system
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN boost_cooldown_until DATETIME;
```

**Penalty Rules Implementation:**
- **Booster Wins**: Net boost goes to post, challenger gets 24hr challenge penalty
- **Challenger Wins**: Post boost = 0 + 24hr cooldown, booster gets 24hr boost penalty
- **Tie Games**: No penalties applied, fair outcome for both participants

#### 3. **Complete War Flow Architecture**
**War Challenge Flow:**
1. User A boosts a post (+10 boost, -10 credits)
2. User B sees boosted post and clicks "Challenge War" button
3. User A receives notification: "This user would like to challenge you to a boost battle. Accept or decline?"
4. Upon acceptance: 2-minute timer starts for both players
5. Real-time battle: A presses "boost" (3 credits), B presses "unboost" (3 credits)
6. Victory calculated based on net actions when timer expires
7. Consequences automatically applied based on winner

#### 4. **Advanced Security & Validation**
**CSRF Protection:**
- Added `@require_csrf` decorator to all war endpoints
- Challenge, accept, decline, and action endpoints fully protected
- Integrated with existing CSRF token system

**Business Logic Validation:**
- **Self-Challenge Prevention**: Users cannot challenge themselves
- **Boost Requirement**: Only boosted posts (score > 0) can be challenged
- **Penalty Checking**: Users under penalties cannot boost/challenge
- **Cooldown Enforcement**: Posts under cooldown cannot be boosted
- **Credit Validation**: Sufficient credits required for all actions

#### 5. **Professional Victory Calculation System**
**Advanced War Finish Logic:**
```python
# Count actual actions during war
challenger_boosts = len([a for a in challenger_actions if a.action == "boost"])
challenger_unboosts = len([a for a in challenger_actions if a.action == "unboost"])

# Calculate net scores
challenger_net_score = challenger_boosts - challenged_unboosts
challenged_net_score = challenged_boosts - challenger_unboosts

# Apply consequences based on winner
if challenger_net_score > challenged_net_score:
    # Booster wins: Apply net boost to post, penalize challenger
elif challenged_net_score > challenger_net_score:
    # Challenger wins: Reset post boost, penalize booster
else:
    # Tie: No penalties applied
```

#### 6. **Complete Backend Architecture**
**Enhanced War Routes (`gaming_routes/wars.py`):**
- **Challenge System**: `/api/wars/challenge` with penalty validation
- **Accept/Decline**: `/api/wars/accept` and `/api/wars/decline` with user verification
- **Battle Actions**: `/api/wars/action` for boost/unboost during battles
- **War Status**: `/api/wars/status` for real-time battle monitoring

**Automatic War Resolution (`tasks/wars_finish.py`):**
- Background task processes expired wars automatically
- Counts boost/unboost actions during battle window
- Calculates winners and applies penalties
- Awards war badges to victors
- Comprehensive logging for all war outcomes

#### 7. **Enhanced Boost System Integration**
**Penalty-Aware Boost Endpoint:**
```python
# Check user boost penalty before allowing boost
penalty_error = _check_boost_penalty(current_user.id)
if penalty_error:
    return jsonify({"error": penalty_error}), 400

# Check post cooldown before allowing boost
cooldown_error = _check_post_cooldown(post_id)
if cooldown_error:
    return jsonify({"error": cooldown_error}), 400
```

**Updated Cost Structure:**
- **Regular Boost**: 10 credits for +10 boost points (unchanged)
- **War Actions**: 3 credits for +1/-1 action points (high-frequency battles)
- **Challenge**: Free to issue challenges (encourages competition)

### Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. **Database Models Enhancement**
**Existing Models Utilized:**
- `BoostWar`: Tracks war state, participants, timing, and results
- `BoostWarAction`: Records every boost/unboost action during battles
- `PostBoost`: Maintains boost transaction history

**New Penalty Fields Added:**
- User-level penalties for boost and challenge restrictions
- Post-level cooldowns for boost protection after war losses

#### 2. **War State Management**
**War Status Flow:**
- `pending` → War invitation sent, awaiting accept/decline
- `active` → 2-minute battle in progress, actions being recorded
- `finished` → War completed, winner determined, penalties applied
- `declined` → War invitation rejected by challenged user

#### 3. **Real-Time Battle Mechanics**
**Action Validation During Wars:**
- Participants can only boost their own post or unboost opponent's post
- Credit deduction happens immediately for each action
- Failed actions automatically refunded via transaction rollback
- War timer strictly enforced (exactly 2 minutes)

#### 4. **Professional Error Handling**
**Comprehensive Validation:**
- War existence and status verification
- User participation validation
- Time window enforcement
- Credit sufficiency checking
- Penalty status verification
- Post availability confirmation

### Security Features

#### 1. **CSRF Protection**
- All war endpoints protected with `@require_csrf` decorator
- Challenge, accept, decline, and action endpoints secured
- Consistent with existing application security patterns

#### 2. **Authorization Controls**
- Users can only accept wars they were challenged to

## COMPREHENSIVE API & AUTHENTICATION OVERHAUL - September 21, 2025

### Summary
Complete systematic review and fix of all authentication, API endpoints, game counter logic, and JavaScript issues following the NO SHORTCUTS POLICY with root cause analysis and professional solutions.

### Critical Root Cause Identified & Fixed

#### 🎯 **Game Counter Bug - ROOT CAUSE FOUND**
**The Problem**: Game counter stuck at "0/5 Free Games Used" despite playing games
**Root Cause**: JavaScript was sending `is_daily: IS_DAILY` but Python expected `daily: p.get("daily")`
**Result**: Score completion marking used wrong puzzle key, preventing proper game tracking

**The Fix**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
const body = { mode: MODE, is_daily: IS_DAILY, ... }

// AFTER (working):
const body = { mode: MODE, daily: IS_DAILY, ... }
```
**Impact**: Game counter now properly increments 0/5 → 1/5 → 2/5 after each completed game

#### 🔐 **Authentication Unification - 8 ENDPOINTS FIXED**
**The Problem**: Multiple API endpoints using inconsistent authentication patterns causing 401 errors
**Root Cause**: Some endpoints used `get_session_user()` (session-only) while `@api_auth_required` decorator checked multiple sources

**Endpoints Fixed with Unified Authentication**:
1. `/api/hint/unlock` - Hint system authentication
2. `/api/hint/ask` - Hint system authentication
3. `/api/game/progress/save` - Game save authentication
4. `/api/game/progress/load` - Game load authentication
5. `/api/game/progress/clear` - Game clear authentication
6. `/api/game/reveal` - Word reveal authentication (ALREADY FIXED)
7. `/game/api/status` - Game status authentication
8. `/api/game/costs` - Game costs authentication
9. `/api/telemetry/wordhunt` - Telemetry user context

**Unified Pattern Applied**:
```python
# NEW STANDARD: Check all authentication sources
user = None
if current_user.is_authenticated:
    user = current_user
elif session.get('user_id'):
    user = db.session.get(User, session.get('user_id'))
elif getattr(g, 'user', None):
    user = g.user
```

#### ⚡ **Missing API Endpoints - CREATED**
**The Problem**: Play Again button showing "Need 5 credits" instead of free games remaining
**Root Cause**: JavaScript calling `/api/game/costs` endpoint that didn't exist

**Solution**: Created complete `/api/game/costs` endpoint
```python
@bp.get("/api/game/costs")
@csrf_exempt
def get_game_costs():
    # Returns costs and user balance/free games for mini word finder
    return jsonify({
        "costs": {"game_start": 5, "reveal": 5},
        "user": {"balance": user.mini_word_credits or 0, "free_games_remaining": free_games_remaining}
    })
```

#### 🔧 **Continue to Next Game Feature**
**The Problem**: When returning to completed puzzle, users saw same puzzle repeatedly
**Solution**: Implemented clean "Continue to Next Game" interface
- Replaces auto-completion screen with professional continue interface
- "Continue to Next Game" button clears completion markers and starts fresh puzzle
- "Main Menu" button for navigation
- Clean UX instead of showing same completed puzzle

## Complete API Authentication Fix & System Bulletproofing - September 21, 2025

### Summary
Successfully resolved critical console errors and API authentication issues affecting the mini-word-finder Flask application through comprehensive system-wide fixes following advanced Flask authentication patterns.

### Problem Scope & Root Cause Analysis
**Initial Issues**: 500 Internal Server Error and 401 Unauthorized errors on API endpoints, with JSON parsing errors due to HTML redirect responses instead of JSON.

**Core Problems Identified**:
1. **Redis Server Unavailability**: Causing 500 errors on leaderboard endpoints
2. **Authentication Middleware Hook Ordering**: `before_request` handlers redirecting APIs to `/login` instead of returning JSON 401s
3. **Multiple Server Processes**: Debug fingerprinting revealed requests hitting different Flask processes on port 5000

### Advanced Technical Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **Redis Fallback System Architecture**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Enhanced `services/leaderboard.py` with comprehensive Redis unavailability handling
- **Fallback Mode**: Returns mock leaderboard data when Redis is down instead of crashing
- **Health Check Integration**: Added `/api/leaderboard/health` endpoint for monitoring
- **Connection Resilience**: Automatic fallback detection with ping-based health checks

#### 2. **Bulletproof Public Route System**
Following expert user guidance, implemented decorator-based approach:
- **`@public` Decorator**: Created `utils/public.py` for marking authentication-exempt routes
- **Attribute-Based Middleware**: Modified auth middleware to check `_public` attribute before enforcement
- **Applied to Critical Endpoints**: Marked all leaderboard read endpoints as public (`/api/leaderboard/top`, `/api/leaderboard/around`, etc.)

#### 3. **Flask-Login API Handler Integration**
- **Unauthorized Handler**: Added `login_manager.unauthorized_handler` for API paths returning JSON 401s
- **Needs Refresh Handler**: Implemented `login_manager.needs_refresh_handler` for session refresh scenarios
- **Path-Based Routing**: Handlers detect `/api/*` paths and return JSON instead of HTML redirects

#### 4. **Global Neutralizer Pattern for Hook Ordering**
**Advanced Solution**: Implemented WSGI-level hook wrapping to prevent future hook ordering issues:
```python
def _skip_api_guard(fn):
    @wraps(fn)
    def _wrapped(*a, **kw):
        if request.path.startswith("/api/"):
            return  # allow pipeline to continue to your require_login
        return fn(*a, **kw)
    return _wrapped

# Wrap all existing hooks to skip API paths
for idx, fn in enumerate(app.before_request_funcs[None]):
    app.before_request_funcs[None][idx] = _skip_api_guard(fn)
```

#### 5. **Production Debugging & Fingerprinting Tools**
- **WSGI Fingerprinting**: Added process ID headers to identify which Flask instance handles requests
- **Hook Inspection**: `/debug/hooks` endpoint for runtime hook analysis
- **Request Neutralizer**: Global bypass system for troubleshooting authentication issues

### Security & Standards Implementation

#### **CSRF Protection Enhancement**
- **Unified CSRF Handling**: All API endpoints properly protected with `@csrf_exempt` or `@require_csrf`
- **Token Verification**: JavaScript CSRF token handling standardized across templates
- **Exemption Strategy**: Public read endpoints exempted, write endpoints protected

#### **Authentication Pattern Consistency**
- **Decorator Standardization**: Moved game endpoints from mixed decorators to consistent `@api_auth_required` pattern
- **JSON Error Responses**: All API endpoints return proper JSON errors instead of HTML redirects
- **Public Endpoint Management**: Clear separation between authenticated and public API access

### Comprehensive Testing & Validation

#### **Smoke Testing Implementation**
Created `smoke_test_api.sh` for regression prevention:
- **Public Endpoints**: Validates 200 JSON responses for leaderboard APIs
- **Protected Endpoints**: Confirms JSON 400/401 responses (not 302 redirects)
- **Redirect Detection**: Automated testing for HTML redirect prevention

#### **Production Deployment Verification**
- **Port Migration**: Moved to PORT=5001 to resolve multiple server process issues
- **Fingerprint Confirmation**: Verified single process handling via WSGI headers
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete API workflow validation from client to database

### Technical Architecture Enhancements

- **Function Signature Errors**: Incorrect parameter passing to helper functions

**Technical Fixes Applied**:

**1. Fixed `api_game_result()` Function**:
```python
# BEFORE (broken SQLite calls):
ensure_profile(user_id, game)
db = get_arcade_db()  # This function didn't exist

# AFTER (proper PostgreSQL):
with pg() as conn:
    ensure_membership(conn, 1, user_id)
    ensure_profile(conn, 1, user_id, game)
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("""UPDATE game_profile SET...""")
```

**2. Fixed `api_leaderboard()` Function**:
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
arcade_db = get_arcade_db()  # Non-existent function
rows = arcade_db.execute("SELECT...")  # SQLite syntax

# AFTER (working):
with pg() as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("""SELECT user_id, wins, plays FROM game_profile
                       WHERE community_id=1 AND game_code=%s...""")
```

**3. Added Missing `/game/api/status` Endpoint**:
```python
@arcade_bp.route("/api/status", methods=["GET"])
def api_game_status():
    """Get game status and credits for current user"""
    # Returns game counters for both tictactoe and connect4
    # Provides credit balance and free games remaining

- **Auto-Detection**: Browser timezone auto-detection on first visit
- **Fallback System**: Graceful UTC fallback for invalid/missing timezones

#### 📱 **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Simplified Messaging**: Daily limit message now just says "Resets at midnight your time zone" (per user request)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Shows "Resets in 3h 45m" type countdown messaging
- **Timezone Picker**: User-friendly interface with search and autocomplete
- **Settings Page**: Complete timezone management at `/settings/timezone`

#### 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

**New Core Files**:
- `timezone_utils.py` - Core timezone validation and calculation utilities
- `timezone_routes.py` - Complete timezone management API (4 endpoints)
- `templates/timezone_settings.html` - User-friendly timezone picker interface
- `add_user_timezone_column.sql` - Production database migration script

**Enhanced Existing Files**:
- `community_service.py` - Timezone-aware daily limit logic with UTC fallback
- `static/js/community.js` - Simplified daily limit modal messaging
- `models.py` - Added user_tz column to User model

#### 🚀 **API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/user/timezone` - Set/update user timezone with validation
- `GET /api/user/timezone` - Get current timezone and next reset information
- `GET /api/timezones/search` - Search for valid timezones with autocomplete
- `POST /api/timezone/detect` - Auto-detect and set timezone from browser

#### 🔒 **Production-Ready Features**

**Database Functions**:
- Timezone-aware reset calculations using user's local midnight
- Automatic daily counter resets based on user timezone
- Backward compatibility with existing UTC-based system
- Race condition handling for concurrent access

**Error Handling**:

- Timezone search with debounced autocomplete

### Implementation Highlights

#### Before: Global UTC Reset
```
All users: Daily limits reset at midnight UTC
Message: "Resets at midnight UTC" (technical, confusing)
```

#### After: Personalized Timezone Reset
```
Each user: Daily limits reset at their local midnight
Message: "Resets at midnight your time zone" (simple, clear)
Real-time: "Resets in 3h 45m" (helpful countdown)
```

#### Database Schema Migration
```sql
-- Add timezone support to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN user_tz VARCHAR(50);
COMMENT ON COLUMN users.user_tz IS 'IANA timezone identifier for user-specific daily limit resets';
```

#### Smart Timezone Detection
```javascript
// Auto-detect user timezone on first visit
const detectedTz = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;
// Validates: "America/New_York" ✅, "Eastern" ✅, "invalid" ❌ with fallback
```

### Production Deployment

#### Next Steps for Live Deployment
1. **Register Blueprint**:
   ```python
   from timezone_routes import timezone_bp
   app.register_blueprint(timezone_bp)
   ```

2. **Apply Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f add_user_timezone_column.sql
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pytz
   ```

#### Operations & Monitoring
