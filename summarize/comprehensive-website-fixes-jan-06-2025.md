## Latest Updates - September 18, 2025

### Production-Ready Game Persistence & Session Security Implementation

#### Game State Persistence System
**Problem Solved**: Game progress was lost on page refresh, affecting user experience.

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Database-backed persistence** using `user_preferences` TEXT column
- ‚úÖ **Atomic operations** with SQLAlchemy ORM for both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive validation** (300 words max, 10K cells max, 200KB payload limit)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-expiry**: Regular games (6h), Daily games (24h)
- ‚úÖ **Fallback system**: Database ‚Üí localStorage graceful degradation
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready**: Error handling, logging, concurrency control

**Technical Details**:
- Database schema: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN user_preferences TEXT`
- API endpoints: `/api/game/progress/save`, `/api/game/progress/load`, `/api/game/progress/clear`
- Frontend integration: `saveGameState()`, `loadGameState()`, `restoreGameState()`
- Cache busting: Updated to `v=20250918e`

#### Reveal System Integration
**Problem Solved**: 5-credit reveal system wasn't marking words as found on the board.

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Word-finding algorithm**: `find_word_in_grid()` searches all 8 directions
- ‚úÖ **Actual positions**: Reveals show real word locations, not random highlights
- ‚úÖ **Persistent highlights**: Found words stay highlighted after reveal
- ‚úÖ **Credits integration**: Proper 5-credit deduction with validation

#### Session Security Enhancement
**Problem Solved**: Users remained logged in after closing browser.

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Browser-session only login**: Sessions expire when browser closes
- ‚úÖ **No persistent cookies**: Removed `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME` and `REMEMBER_COOKIE_DURATION`
- ‚úÖ **Security improvement**: `login_user(user, remember=False)` prevents auto-login
- ‚úÖ **User convenience**: Stay logged in during active browsing session

#### Database Compatibility Fixes
**Problem Solved**: PostgreSQL-specific JSONB operators causing production errors.

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Database-agnostic code**: Replaced `#>`, `jsonb_set`, `jsonb_each` with ORM operations
- ‚úÖ **Field name consistency**: Fixed `foundCells` ‚Üí `found_cells`, `isDaily` ‚Üí `daily`
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Graceful fallback for missing columns/data
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform**: Works with both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)

#### Files Modified
- `blueprints/game.py` - Production persistence endpoints with validation
- `static/js/play.js` - Database integration and error handling (v20250918e)
- `templates/play.html` - Cache buster updates
- `static/js/credits.js` - Reveal system integration (v20250918b)
- `app.py` - Session security configuration
- `routes.py` - Login behavior modification
- `migrations/add_jsonb_preferences.sql` - Database schema migration
