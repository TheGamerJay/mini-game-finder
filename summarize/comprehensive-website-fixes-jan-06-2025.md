## Session Activity Tracking & Auto-Logout System - January 19, 2025

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive session management with activity monitoring to keep users logged in while active, but provide polite warnings before auto-logout due to inactivity.

### Problem Solved
- Users want to stay logged in as long as they're active
- Security requires automatic logout after prolonged inactivity
- Need smooth user experience without surprise logouts
- Coordination needed between frontend and backend authentication state

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Backend Session Configuration (app.py)**
- **Rolling 14-day sessions**: `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME=timedelta(days=14)`
- **Activity-based refresh**: `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST=True`
- **Remember-me functionality**: `REMEMBER_COOKIE_DURATION=timedelta(days=30)`
- **Inactivity timeout**: 30 minutes with 2-minute warning threshold

#### 2. **Activity Tracking System**
- **Constants**: `INACTIVITY_LIMIT_SEC = 60 * 30` (30 min), `WARN_AT_SEC = 60 * 2` (2 min warning)
- **Activity monitor**: `touch_activity()` before_request handler tracks `last_activity` timestamp
- **Auto-logout**: Users exceeding inactivity limit are automatically logged out
- **Session APIs**: `/api/session/status` and `/api/session/ping` for frontend monitoring

#### 3. **Frontend Activity Monitoring (base.html)**
- **Polls session status**: Every 15 seconds via `/api/session/status`
- **"Still there?" modal**: Appears when 2 minutes remain, countdown timer included
- **User activity detection**: Monitors click, keydown, mousemove, touchstart events
- **Throttled API calls**: Pings server every 10 seconds on activity (throttled to prevent spam)
- **Auto-redirect**: Redirects to login if no response within 2 minutes

#### 4. **Persistent Login Enhancement (routes.py)**
- **Login persistence**: `login_user(user, remember=True)` and `session.permanent = True`
- **Activity initialization**: `session["last_activity"] = int(time.time())` on login/register
- **Cache headers**: Added no-cache headers to login page to prevent cached redirects

#### 5. **API Security**
- **Cache-control headers**: Session APIs have `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0`
- **Authentication coordination**: Frontend checks `data-authenticated` attribute consistency
- **CSRF protection**: Session ping endpoint includes proper CSRF handling

### User Experience Flow
1. **Active users**: Sessions stay alive indefinitely as long as they're using the site
2. **Inactive users**: After 28 minutes of inactivity, see "Still there?" modal
3. **Warning period**: 2-minute countdown with "I'm still here" button
4. **Auto-logout**: If no response, graceful redirect to login page
5. **Smooth return**: Can log back in immediately without losing progress

### Files Modified
- `app.py` - Session configuration, activity tracking, session APIs
- `routes.py` - Persistent login settings, cache headers, activity initialization
- `templates/base.html` - Frontend JavaScript for activity monitoring and warning modal

### Technical Features
- **Cross-tab coordination**: Activity in any tab refreshes session for all tabs
- **Network resilience**: Handles temporary network issues gracefully
- **Security compliance**: Maintains security standards while improving UX
- **Database agnostic**: Works with both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Mobile friendly**: Touch events included for mobile device activity detection

### Deployment Status

‚úÖ Session activity tracking implemented and tested
‚úÖ "Still there?" modal system functional
‚úÖ Rolling sessions working across browser sessions
‚úÖ Frontend/backend authentication state fully coordinated
‚úÖ No surprise logouts - users only logged out after clear warning

## Complete Template and Route Cleanup - January 19, 2025

### Summary
Comprehensive audit and cleanup to ensure frontend, backend, templates, and routes are all consistent and properly aligned. Removed all broken, redundant, incomplete, or old files.

### Problem Solved
- Template organization was inconsistent with old files mixed with current ones
- Missing template files causing route errors
- Frontend/backend misalignment and redundant code
- Need for proper archival of old files without cluttering active templates

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Template Organization**
- **Archive cleanup**: Moved old templates from `templates/archive/` to `archive_backup/` for proper preservation
- **Missing template restoration**: Restored `templates/terms.html` from backup archive
- **Store template positioning**: Ensured `templates/brand_store.html` properly positioned for store route
- **Template verification**: Confirmed all `render_template()` calls have corresponding template files

#### 2. **Route Consistency Verification**
- **Navigation validation**: Verified all navigation links in `base.html` match actual route definitions
- **Blueprint template check**: Confirmed arcade and riddle blueprint templates exist in correct locations
- **URL pattern consistency**: Ensured URL patterns are consistent across frontend and backend
- **Function name alignment**: Verified all `url_for('core.X')` calls match actual function names

#### 3. **Frontend Code Cleanup**
- **Redundant code removal**: Confirmed removal of old idle timeout code in `auth-check.js`
- **API endpoint verification**: Verified all API endpoints in JS files match backend routes
- **Navigation link validation**: Checked navigation links point to correct arcade game routes
- **CSRF token consistency**: Validated CSRF token patterns are consistent across JS files

#### 4. **File Structure Organization**
- **Proper archival**: Old brand templates safely moved to `archive_backup/` directory
- **Broken reference cleanup**: Ensured no broken template references remain
- **Clean separation**: Clear distinction between active and archived templates
- **Dependency verification**: No missing dependencies or circular references

### User Experience Impact
- All navigation links now work correctly

## Content Security Policy (CSP) Violation Fix - January 19, 2025

### Summary
Resolved critical Content Security Policy violation by moving inline session monitoring script from base template to external JavaScript file.

### Problem Solved
- **CSP Error**: "Refused to execute inline script because it violates script-src 'self'"
- **Security Compliance**: Inline session monitoring code violated strict CSP policy
- **User Experience**: Error was preventing proper session management functionality

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Script Externalization**
- **New file creation**: Created `static/js/session-monitor.js` with complete session monitoring functionality
- **Inline script removal**: Removed large inline `<script>` block from `templates/base.html`
- **External reference**: Added proper script reference with version cache busting
- **Functionality preservation**: Maintained all session timeout and "Still there?" modal features

#### 2. **CSP Compliance**
- **Security policy adherence**: Full compliance with `script-src 'self'` without requiring `'unsafe-inline'`
- **External script loading**: All scripts now load from external files with `defer` attribute
- **Cache optimization**: Version parameter ensures proper cache invalidation
- **Security hardening**: Eliminates need for weakening CSP policy

#### 3. **Session Management Preservation**
- **Activity tracking**: User activity monitoring (click, keydown, mousemove, touchstart) maintained
- **Auto-logout system**: 30-minute inactivity timeout with 2-minute warning preserved
- **"Still there?" modal**: Warning modal with countdown timer fully functional
- **Session ping**: Throttled API calls to maintain session activity preserved

### Security Benefits
- **Enhanced security**: Maintains strict CSP without compromising functionality
- **XSS protection**: External scripts reduce attack surface compared to inline code
- **Performance optimization**: External scripts benefit from browser caching
- **Maintainability**: Separated concerns make code easier to manage and debug

### Files Modified
- `static/js/session-monitor.js` - New external session monitoring script
- `templates/base.html` - Removed inline script, added external script reference

### Deployment Status
‚úÖ Successfully committed and pushed (commit: `20b433e`)
‚úÖ CSP violation completely resolved
‚úÖ All session management functionality preserved
‚úÖ Security policy compliance maintained
‚úÖ No user experience impact - seamless transition
