   - Added accessibility attributes

4. **Project Structure**
   - Updated requirements.txt (removed gunicorn dependency)
   - Enhanced README.md with auto-push policy
   - Proper Flask app structure with templates

### Files Modified
- `app.py` - Complete rewrite with smart placement logic
- `templates/index.html` - Updated styling and layout
- `requirements.txt` - Simplified dependencies
- `README.md` - Added auto-push policy documentation

### Technical Details
- Flask 3.0.3 backend
- Jinja2 templating
- 15-word candidate dictionary

- Responsive design with monospace font

### Deployment Status
✅ Successfully committed and pushed to GitHub
✅ Fixed Railway deployment configuration with Procfile
✅ Updated app.py to use PORT environment variable
✅ Application running locally on port 5000
✅ Railway deployment should now work properly

### Railway Deployment Fixes
- Added `Procfile` with `web: python app.py` start command
- Modified app.py to read PORT from environment variables
- Removed debug mode for production deployment
- Commit: `823e03a` - "Fix Railway deployment configuration"

### Profile Image System Upgrade (September 15, 2025)
**Complete overhaul of profile image handling with robust base64 database storage**

#### Problem Solved
- Fixed broken MP4 profile video display (404 errors)
- Eliminated file storage reliability issues across deployments
- Resolved profile page crashes due to datetime handling errors

#### Technical Implementation
1. **New ProfileImageManager System**
   - `image_manager.py` - Complete base64 image processing and storage
   - PIL-based image optimization and resizing (max 1024px, 85% JPEG quality)
   - Header-based file validation (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, MP4)
   - Smart size limits: 5MB images, 50MB videos

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `profile_image_data` (TEXT) - base64 encoded media
   - Added `profile_image_mime_type` (VARCHAR) - MIME type storage
   - Added missing `amount_delta` column to credit_txns table
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing `profile_image_url`

3. **Frontend Template Updates**
   - Updated `templates/profile.html` and `templates/community.html`
   - Removed all borders and circular cropping from images
   - Natural aspect ratio display for both images and videos
   - Auto-playing looped videos with proper fallbacks

4. **Backend Route Improvements**
   - Fixed datetime handling in `routes.py` profile view
   - Integrated new image manager with existing upload endpoints
   - Added proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

#### Files Modified
- `routes.py` - Fixed profile datetime errors and integrated image manager
- `models.py` - Added new base64 storage columns
- `image_manager.py` - New comprehensive image processing system
- `templates/profile.html` - Updated image display (no borders/shapes)
- `templates/community.html` - Updated avatar display (no borders/shapes)
- `migrate_to_base64_images.py` - Database migration script
- `fix_credit_txns.py` - Database column fix script

#### Deployment Status
✅ All changes committed and pushed (commit: `4f20b67`)
✅ Database migrations completed on production via Beekeeper Studio
✅ Local testing successful with MP4 video upload
✅ Profile page loads without errors
✅ Images display in natural rectangular format without borders
